Place the static vehicle images in this folder so Vite serves them from /images.

Steps:

1. Save the attached Cub image from the chat as `cub.jpg`.
2. Copy the file here: `d:\ITS\public\images\cub.jpg`.
3. Restart the dev server if needed: `npm run dev`.

After that, the Honda Cub (id: 6) will use `/images/cub.jpg` as its `imageUrl` and display in the app.
